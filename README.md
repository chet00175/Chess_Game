# Overview
This is a simple website which allows two users to play chess games with each other and is built using the WAMP stack. In addition to the entry page of the website in which the users can play, there is another page called the history page in which users can view all of the games that have been played so far and naviagate through all of the moves that have been made in each of the games played. The images used for the chess pieces on the webpage were taken from http://www.virtualpieces.net/icons.

# Installation
The environment needed for running this application can be installed directly with WAMP server which can be downloaded from http://www.wampserver.com/en/. Alternatively, the Apache Web Server, PHP and MySQL can all be installed individually and configured together. In either case, to start the website, simply download the folder and place it into the directory in which Apache serve files from (this can be set in Apache's httpd.conf file by changing the default DocumentRoot). After this, open http://localhost:80/index.html in your web browser.

# Installation (Using Vagrant)
A LAMP environment can also be used to run this application and this can be automated directly using Vagrant. The _vagrant folder comes with a Vagrant-file which sets up a Ubuntu base image and installs LAMP on it automatically using shell provisioning. It also sets the default password of the root account for MySQL to be 'mysql'. To run the application this way, first install vagrant on your machine. Then place the _vagrant folder and its contents anywhere on your machine. Open the terminal in the _vagrant folder and run 'vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64' to add Ubuntu 14.04 LTS to Vagrant. Then create a folder called 'data' in the _vagrant folder and place the contents of the chess_game in the that folder. After this do 'vagrant up' to run the box. When this is done is finished you can directly view the application on the host's browser at 192.168.33.10:80.
