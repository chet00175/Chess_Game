# Overview
This is a simple website which allows two users to play chess games with each other and is built using the WAMP stack. In addition to the entry page of the website in which the users can play, there is another page called the history page in which users can view all of the games that have been played so far and naviagate through all of the moves that have been made in each of the games played. The images used for the chess pieces on the webpage were taken from http://www.virtualpieces.net/icons.

# Installation
The environment needed for running this application can be installed directly with WAMP server which can be downloaded from http://www.wampserver.com/en/. Alternatively, the Apache Web Server, PHP and MySQL can all be installed individually and configured together. In either case, to start the website, simply download the folder and place it into the directory in which Apache serve files from (this can be set in Apache's httpd.conf file by changing the default DocumentRoot). After this, open http://localhost:80/index.html in your web browser.
